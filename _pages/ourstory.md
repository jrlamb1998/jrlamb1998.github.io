Like many ideas, Hibble started as a dinner conversation. Sophie and Jack were on a backpacking trip in the Sierra Nevadas. As they were unloading their heavy backpacks, they realized that while they had at least a dozen different foods, their canine companion had just one bag of kibble. *"I sure wish I could eat like that dog!"* both thought.

Over the next few months, the idea grew and grew, until Jack and Sophie couldn’t stand it anymore. They desperately wanted a delicious, vegan food to satisfy all of their dietary needs. One fateful night, they ordered Hibblizer 1.0 -- a $16 sausage extruder. With a bowl each of beans and rice, the first ever Hibble was born!

Hibble was a joy from the first bite. It quickly became a sensation in Jack and Sophie’s dorm, where they spent many evenings perfecting the recipe. Although the COVID-19 pandemic delayed development, the Hibble dream lived on.

Finally, Hibble was ready for the next level: researching late into the night, Jack and Sophie finally purchased Hibblizer 2.0 and set to work creating the food of the future.

The new Hibbilizer came with its own set of challenges.
